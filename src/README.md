Common environment for different geometry algorithms
====================================================

The idea is to implement different geometry divide and conquer algorithms in
one environment: with shared data structures, common preprocessing. This is
convenient if one needs most of these algos in one application.

Algorithms
-----------
* Convex Hull
* Voronoi diagram
[TODO: add your algo here]

Building
----------
1. Clone this repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/AnatoliyS/Geometry.git

2. Build and run VoronoiDemo:
$ ./build.sh
